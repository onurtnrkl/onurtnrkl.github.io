**Who we share your Personal Information with:** We share your Personal Information with certain third parties as part of our operation of the Service, whether shared by us or gathered directly by third parties through SDKs integrated into the Service.

**Children’s Privacy:** These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

**Links to Other Sites:** The Service may contain links to other sites and applications. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. These external services are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites and mobile applications. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
